/**
 * SECTION:glx-manager
 * @Short_description: GL(X) configuration management
 * @see_also: #LdmGPUConfig
 * @Title: LdmGLXManager
 *
 * An LdmGLXManager is used to provide control over the GL(X) system implementation.
 * Whilst most of what is controlled applies to "pure" GL implementations, the real
 * requirement is in dealing with explicit GLX implementations such as the NVIDIA
 * proprietary libGL.
 *
 * To make these "work", usually requires a very explicit X11 configuration as well
 * as the control of library availability. On non GLVND systems, the libGL files
 * from mesa (technically a GLX implementation in this instance) will conflict
 * on the filesystem with the ones from the proprietary driver.
 *
 * In the "new world" of GLVND these paths no longer conflict, however this does
 * not alter the fact that an X11 configuration needs writing explicitly for these
 * cases. Additionally the X11 `libglx.so` extension from X.Org is typically replaced
 * by the proprietary driver's own libglx.so implementation. This is usually handled
 * by either a filesystem mangling, or by using a patched X.Org server which understands
 * special directives to point to the real libglx.so.
 *
 * In short we have two worlds:
 *
 * - "Alternatives" links: Filesystem butchery is performed and `ld.so.conf` may also be used.
 * - GLVND: No filesystem butchery, and requiring patched X.Org for Extensions directory support.
 *
 * The LdmGLXManager requires privileges to be used, and will perform configurations as
 * the system dictates. This is only really intended for use by `linux-driver-management configure
 * gpu`
