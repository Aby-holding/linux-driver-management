 * @Short_description: HID Device abstraction
 * @see_also: #LdmDevice
 * @Title: LdmHIDDevice
 *
 * An LdmHIDDevice is a specialised implementation of the #LdmDevice which
 * is aware of HID interface capabilities. This class is never directly
 * created by the user, but is instead returned by the #LdmManager.
 *
 * This class extends the base #LdmDevice to add HID specific data.
 * Typically these devices are part of a USB device tree, and extend the
 * root USB device presented to the end user.
 *
 * Users can test if a device is a HID device without having to cast, by
 * simply checking the #LdmDevice:device-type:
 *
 * |[<!-- language="C" -->
 *      if (ldm_device_has_type(device, LDM_DEVICE_TYPE_HID)) {
 *              g_message("Found HID device");
 *      }
 *
 *      // Alternatively..
 *      if (LDM_IS_HID_DEVICE(device)) {
 *              g_message("Found HID device through casting");
 *      }
 * ]|
