.SH "NAME"
\fBldm\-session\-init\fR \- Conditionally activate hybrid GPU for X11
.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBldm\-session\-init\fR
.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBldm\-session\-init\fR is unconditionally executed by the display manager at the start of the X11 session to \fBmaybe\fR handle bootstrap of the hybrid GPU\. If the hybrid GPU driver is not activated, or is missing the main driver, this program will exit immediately\. This is handled very quickly so as not to introduce a login penalty for non hybrid GPU users\.
.
.P
Currently this command only supports Optimus™ graphics that have been correctly configured via \fBlinux\-driver\-management(1)\fR\. Once this has been correctly established, the relevant \fBxrandr(1)\fR calls are made to set up the primary output provider to allow the discrete GPU to function as the "primary" graphics\.
.
.P
For users who do not have a display manager, you can safely place a call to \fBldm\-session\-init\fR in your \fBxinitrc\fR or equivalent\.
.
.SH "EXIT STATUS"
On success, 0 is returned\. A non\-zero return code signals a failure\.
